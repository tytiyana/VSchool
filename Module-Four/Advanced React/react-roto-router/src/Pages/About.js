            <p>We're a family owned company. The company started when Joseph Alexander starting taking jobs around the neighborhood to make ends meet after being laid off from a company he had worked for, for 20 years. With the help of his 6 sons he was able to monopolize his entire state in just under 9 months. In the next 3 years to come he built an empire of 4 franchises in neighboring states. Now almost 60 years later, he has franchises in all states except Hawaii. </p>
