 Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the largest (without using Math.max())

largest([3, 5, 2, 8, 1]) => 8
Write a function that takes an array of words and a character and returns each word that has that character present.

lettersWithStrings(["#3", "$$$", "C%4!", "Hey!"], "!") => ["C%4!", "Hey!"]
Write a function that takes a num1 and num2 and returns whether num1 is divisible by num2.

isDivisible(4, 2) => true
isDivisible(9, 3) => true
isDivisible(15, 4) => false
A Bigger Picture
Breaking problems down into approachable problems is an important skill. The four steps of the problem solving prosess is a good place to start.

The more of these puzzles you solve, the more patterns you'll see. It'll take time and focus to develop the deductive reasoning to use old patterns you've seen to solve new problems.

Having the syntax memorized and a good understanding of the tools available to you will really help, but much of that will come with practice.

If you get stuck
Remember to log your function call:

console.log(isDivisible(4, 2))
If that command logs undefined, it's likely because the function isn't returning anything. Make sure your function is returning something!

That something will likely get defined before a for loop and returned after.

Making sure you've done step 1 correct (understanding the problem) will save you heart ache in any code challenge problem solving.
